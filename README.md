# Celestial Canvas: The Omega Engine

**Celestial Canvas** is the definitive generative, interactive art engine. It is not a background; it is a destination. Every time the page is loaded, a unique, living cosmos is born, complete with its own aesthetic, its own laws of physics, and its own set of mysterious powers for you to discover and wield.

This is the ultimate version, built on the powerful **Omega Engine**. It is a system designed for maximum variety, maximum fun, and maximum unpredictability. It will likely never create the same universe twice.

## The Core Concept: The Blueprint System

The Omega Engine is not merely random; it is generative. It builds each universe from a **Blueprint**, a comprehensive thematic profile that ensures every element—from the shape of the particles to the nature of your power—feels cohesive and intentional.

### Universe Blueprints

The engine forges each session around one of these core Blueprints:

*   **`Classical:`** A beautiful and balanced cosmos of stars and nebulae, governed by familiar forces.
*   **`Organic:`** A living, breathing universe of soft, flowing matter, featuring particle trails and symbiotic powers.
*   **`Digital:`** A universe of information. Expect particles made of text characters, interconnected data webs, and glitch-based powers.
*   **`Cosmic Horror:`** A strange, unsettling, and often monochrome universe. Expect eerie physics, void-like events, and reality-bending powers.
*   **`Painterly:`** A world of beautiful, smearing particle trails that create an ever-evolving oil painting on your screen.

## A Universe of Infinite Features

The Omega Engine has a vast and chaotic toolbox of features to draw from, ensuring no two universes are alike.

### A Vast Arsenal of Powers
Your powers are a surprise on each visit, assigned to your left and right mouse buttons.

#### **Primary "Left-Click" Powers:**
*   **`Comet:`** The classic swirling attractor that gathers matter.
*   **`Void:`** A powerful repulsor that carves out empty space.
*   **`The Shaper:`** Force all nearby particles into a single, rotating geometric shape.
*   **`The Weaver:`** Create persistent, tangible links between particles, weaving a permanent web.
*   **`Force Field:`** Project an invisible, bouncy barrier.
*   **`Solar Flare:`** Unleash a powerful, cone-shaped blast of force.
*   **`The Scribe:`** Paint new particles made of random text characters into the world.
*   **`Chain Lightning:`** Arc raw energy between nearby particles.
*   **`Time Warp:`** A field around your cursor that dramatically slows any particles that enter.
*   **`The Symbiote:`** Capture particles to form a living, writhing tail that follows your cursor.
*   **`Black Hole:`** A hyper-aggressive vortex that consumes and destroys any matter it touches.
*   **`Pulsar:`** Your cursor emits regular, powerful shockwaves.
*   **`The Alchemist:`** A strange force that doesn't move particles, but instantly changes their color.

#### **Secondary "Right-Click" Powers:**
*   **`Supernova:`** Instantly trigger a "Big Bang" explosion.
*   **`Wormhole:`** Create an entry and exit point to teleport particles across the canvas.
*   **`Gravity Well:`** Place a new, stationary gravity well on the canvas.
*   **`Glitch:`** Instantly and violently scramble the positions of all particles.
*   **`Invert:`** Invert the colors of the background and particles in a flash.
*   **`Spotlight:`** Dramatically fade all particles outside a radius around your cursor.
*   **`Toggle Trails:`** Instantly turn the `Painterly` trail effect on or off.
*   **`Anchor:`** Instantly freeze all particles in place.
*   **`The Sculptor:`** Shrinks particles near the cursor.

### A Living, Autonomous Cosmos
The universe does not wait for you. It is subject to random, ambient events:

*   **`The Great Contraction:`** The walls of the universe will slowly close in, crushing all matter together before exploding back out in a new Big Bang.
*   **`Cosmic Message:`** The universe will spontaneously arrange its particles to spell out a cryptic, thematic word.
*   **`Void Pockets:`** Strange, dead zones will appear where all physics are nullified.
*   **`Binary Stars:`** Two autonomous gravity wells will appear, pulling the cosmos into beautiful, swirling galaxies.
*   **`Pulsing Core:`** A "heartbeat" will emanate from the center of the screen, creating gentle, rhythmic waves.
*   **`Meteor Showers:`** Volleys of high-speed particles will periodically streak across the screen.

## The Seeding Engine: Capture & Share
Every unique universe is born from a **Seed**—a short string of characters that acts as its unique DNA.

*   **Capture:** A discreet button in the bottom-left corner allows you to copy the current universe's Seed (and a shareable URL) to your clipboard.
*   **Revisit & Share:** Pasting a seed into the URL (`index.html?seed=COSMIC-CHAOS-1138`) will allow anyone, anywhere, to experience the exact same universe you discovered.

## How to Use

1.  Save the code as a single `index.html` file.
2.  Open it in any modern web browser.
3.  Refresh the page to generate a new, unique universe.
4.  Use the "Capture Seed" button to save and share the URL of your favorite discoveries.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (for background gradients, animations, and glow effects)
*   **JavaScript (ES6)** (for the Omega Engine, generative logic, and all physics)
*   **particles.js:** Used as a lightweight rendering foundation, now heavily extended by a custom physics and interaction engine.
