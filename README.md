# Celestial Canvas: The Omega Engine (Final Version)

**Celestial Canvas** is the definitive generative, interactive art engine. It is both a destination for discovery and a powerful creative tool. At its heart is the **Omega Engine**, a system designed for maximum variety and unpredictability, ensuring that it will likely never create the same universe twice.

This final version is a complete experience, offering two distinct ways to play: **Discovery Mode**, a classic journey into the unknown, and **Sandbox Mode**, the ultimate creative suite for designing your own cosmos.

## The Core Concept: Dual Modes

### 1. Discovery Mode
The classic Celestial Canvas experience. Every time you start or a cataclysm occurs, a unique, living cosmos is born from a random **Seed**. Each universe comes complete with its own aesthetic, its own laws of physics, a unique set of powers for you to wield, and a tailored objective to complete.

### 2. Sandbox Mode
Unleash your creativity. The Sandbox Editor gives you complete control to design your own perfect universe. Mix and match every core component of the engine, save your creation, and even generate a unique URL to share your masterpiece with others.

## A Universe of Infinite Features

The Omega Engine has a vast and chaotic toolbox of features to draw from, ensuring no two universes are alike.

### Ten Universe Blueprints
The engine forges each session around one of these core Blueprints:

*   **`Classical:`** A beautiful and balanced cosmos of stars and nebulae, governed by familiar forces.
*   **`Organic:`** A living, breathing universe of soft, flowing matter, featuring particle trails and symbiotic powers.
*   **`Digital:`** A universe of information. Expect particles made of text characters, interconnected data webs, and glitch-based powers.
*   **`Cosmic Horror:`** A strange, unsettling, and often monochrome universe with reality-bending powers.
*   **`Painterly:`** A world of beautiful, smearing particle trails that create an ever-evolving oil painting on your screen.
*   **`Aquatic:`** A deep-sea simulation with gentle currents, bioluminescent particles, and water-themed powers.
*   **`Crystalline:`** A universe of sharp, geometric forms where powers involve shattering, growing, and resonating crystal structures.
*   **`Kinetic:`** A high-energy cosmos built around physics and motion, featuring powers to fling particles and create bouncy barriers.
*   **`Celestial:`** An astronomical simulation focused on creating star nurseries and drawing constellations in the void.
*   **`Chrono:`** A universe governed by the laws of time, featuring powers to dilate, speed up, and rewind the flow of particles.

### A Vast Arsenal of Powers
Your powers are a surprise in Discovery Mode and are fully selectable in the Sandbox. They are assigned to your left and right mouse buttons (or touch controls) and are themed to each blueprint. Examples include creating black holes, shattering particles into fragments, painting new stars, or even rewinding time.

### A Living, Autonomous Cosmos
The universe does not wait for you. It is subject to random, ambient events such as:

*   **`The Great Contraction:`** The walls of the universe slowly close in, crushing all matter together.
*   **`Cosmic Message:`** The universe spontaneously arranges its particles to spell out a cryptic word.
*   **`Meteor Showers:`** Volleys of high-speed particles periodically streak across the screen.
*   **`Temporal Rifts:`** Strange zones of fast-forwarded or slowed-down time appear and disappear.

### The Challenge System
To add a layer of gameplay, each universe in Discovery Mode presents you with a unique, optional objective tailored to its blueprint. Complete challenges like "Grow a symbiote tail of 50 particles" or "Activate Rewind 10 times" to test your mastery of the universe's powers.

## The Sandbox Editor & Sharing
In Sandbox Mode, you can control:
*   **Blueprint:** The core theme and physics.
*   **Powers:** Any primary and secondary power from the entire game.
*   **Ambient Event:** Choose the background event for your universe.
*   **Physics:** Fine-tune the **Particle Count** and **Friction**.

Once you've created your ideal universe, you can click "Share" to generate a unique URL that saves all your settings. Anyone with the link can experience your exact creation.

## How to Use

1.  Save the code as a single `index.html` file.
2.  Open it in any modern web browser (desktop or mobile).
3.  Choose your mode: **Discovery** for a random journey or **Sandbox** to create your own.
4.  **Controls:**
    *   **Desktop:** Move the mouse to interact. Use Left-Click and Right-Click for your primary and secondary powers.
    *   **Mobile:** Use one finger to interact (primary power) and a two-finger tap for your secondary power.
5.  Use the on-screen UI to start a new universe, pause the simulation, or access the settings panel.

## Persistent Features
Your experience is saved locally in your browser.
*   **Settings:** Toggle sound and switch between a Dark or Light UI theme.
*   **Stats:** The engine tracks your lifetime stats, including universes generated, cataclysms triggered, and challenges completed.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (for background gradients, animations, and UI)
*   **JavaScript (ES6)** (for the Omega Engine, generative logic, and all physics)
*   **particles.js:** Used as a lightweight rendering foundation, now heavily extended by a custom physics and interaction engine.
