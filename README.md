# Celestial Canvas: The Synergy Engine

**Celestial Canvas** is a generative, interactive art engine. It is not a background; it is a destination. Every time the page is loaded, a unique, living cosmos is born, complete with its own aesthetic, its own laws of physics, and its own set of mysterious powers for you to discover and wield.

There is no UI, no controls, and no instructions. The entire experience is about play, discovery, and the emergent beauty that arises from a complex, generative system.

## The Core Concept: The Synergy Engine

This project has evolved beyond simple randomness. It is now powered by the **Synergy Engine**, a system designed to create cohesive, thematic experiences. Instead of picking features from a list, the engine generates a universe around a core **Cosmic Phenomenon**. It then intelligently selects powers, events, and aesthetics that are thematically linked, ensuring that every universe, while unique, feels intentional and harmonious.

### Core Cosmic Phenomena

The Synergy Engine builds each session around one of these fundamental themes:

*   **`Gravity:`** A universe governed by attraction and orbits. Expect powerful attractors, gravity wells, and particles that clump together into beautiful galaxies.
*   **`Flow:`** A universe defined by movement. Expect gentle cosmic winds, particle rivers, and powers that let you guide the current.
*   **`Structure:`** A universe of order and connection. Expect particles that form crystal lattices and interconnected webs, and powers that let you manipulate the entire constellation as one.
*   **`Chaos:`** A violent, high-energy cosmos. Expect fast, unpredictable particles, destructive powers, and a high chance of cataclysmic events.
*   **`Energy:`** A universe crackling with power. Expect glowing particles and powers based on raw energy, like lightning and powerful shockwaves.
*   **`Ethereal:`** A mysterious, ghost-like universe. Expect low-opacity, twinkling particles and reality-bending powers that defy normal physics.
*   **`Crystalline:`** An orderly universe where particles move along grid lines, forming sharp, beautiful, and rigid structures.

## A Universe of Infinite Features

The Synergy Engine has a vast and chaotic toolbox of features to draw from, ensuring no two universes are alike.

### Procedurally Generated Powers
Your powers are a surprise on each visit, assigned to your left and right mouse buttons.

#### **Primary "Left-Click" Powers:**
*   **`Comet:`** The classic swirling attractor that gathers matter.
*   **`Void:`** A powerful repulsor that carves out empty space.
*   **`Force Field:`** Project a temporary, invisible barrier that particles realistically bounce off.
*   **`Solar Flare:`** Unleash a powerful, cone-shaped blast of force.
*   **`Conductor:`** In a universe with linked particles, grab and pull the entire constellation like a tangible web.
*   **`Chain Lightning:`** Arc raw energy between nearby particles.
*   **`Time Warp:`** A field around your cursor that dramatically slows any particles that enter.
*   **`The Symbiote:`** Capture particles to form a living, writhing tail that follows your cursor.
*   **`Black Hole:`** A hyper-aggressive vortex that consumes and destroys any matter it touches.
*   **`Pulsar:`** Your cursor emits regular, powerful shockwaves.
*   **`The Alchemist:`** A strange force that doesn't move particles, but instantly changes their color.

#### **Secondary "Right-Click" Powers:**
*   **`Supernova:`** Instantly trigger a "Big Bang" explosion.
*   **`Wormhole:`** Create an entry and exit point to teleport particles across the canvas.
*   **`Gravity Well:`** Place a new, stationary gravity well on the canvas.
*   **`Set Orbit:`** Click to place a persistent orbital point that all particles will be gently drawn towards.
*   **`Toggle Links:`** A direct utility to instantly turn particle linking on or off.
*   **`Cycle Shape:`** Right-click on particles to instantly change their form.
*   **`Anchor:`** Instantly freeze all particles in place.
*   **`The Sculptor:`** Shrinks particles near the cursor.

### Autonomous, Living Universes
The cosmos does not wait for you. It is subject to random, ambient events:

*   **`Binary Stars:`** Two autonomous gravity wells will appear, pulling the cosmos into beautiful, swirling galaxies.
*   **`Pulsing Core:`** A "heartbeat" will emanate from the center of the screen, creating gentle, rhythmic waves.
*   **`Meteor Showers:`** Volleys of high-speed particles will periodically streak across the screen.
*   **`Supercluster:`** All matter will begin a slow, inexorable drift towards a single, far-off-screen point.
*   **`Phase Shift:`** All particles will periodically and synchronously fade in and out of visibility.

## How to Use

This project is entirely self-contained.

1.  Save the code as a single `index.html` file.
2.  Open it in any modern web browser.
3.  Refresh the page to generate a new universe.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (for background gradients, animations, and glow effects)
*   **JavaScript (ES6)** (for the Synergy Engine, generative logic, and all physics)
*   **particles.js:** Used as a lightweight rendering foundation, now heavily extended by a custom physics and interaction engine.
