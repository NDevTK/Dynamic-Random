# Celestial Canvas: The Chaos Engine

**Celestial Canvas** is not a dynamic background; it is a generative, interactive art engine. It creates a unique, living cosmos on every page load, with its own aesthetic, its own laws of physics, and its own set of mysterious powers for you to discover.

There is no UI, no controls, and no instructions. The entire experience is about play and discovery. Every visit is different, without exception.

## The Core Concept: A New Universe, Every Time

The Chaos Engine is built on a powerful generative system that ensures no two experiences are alike. On each page load, the engine creates a unique **Universe Profile** by making a series of random, high-level decisions. This profile dictates the entire feel of the session, from the ambient physics to the very nature of your interaction.

## The Generative Engine Features

### 1. Universe Archetypes
Every session is born with a fundamental "Archetype" that governs its personality and the pool of possible features:

*   **`Calm:`** A peaceful cosmos. Expect gentle physics, softer colors, and creative, non-destructive powers.
*   **`Volatile:`** High-energy and dangerous. Expect fast-moving particles, glowing bloom effects, destructive powers, and a high chance of chaotic cosmic events.
*   **`Teeming:`** A universe overflowing with life. Expect a huge number of smaller particles, often forming vast, interconnected webs.
*   **`Ethereal:`** Mysterious and strange. Expect low-opacity, twinkling particles, reality-bending powers, and a chance for the universe to be born in a striking monochrome palette.

### 2. Autonomous, Living Universes
The cosmos does not wait for you. It lives and breathes on its own, subject to random, universe-wide events:

*   **`Binary Stars:`** Two autonomous gravity wells will appear, pulling the cosmos into beautiful, swirling galaxies.
*   **`Pulsing Core:`** A "heartbeat" will emanate from the center of the screen, creating gentle, rhythmic waves.
*   **`Meteor Showers:`** Volleys of high-speed particles will periodically streak across the screen.
*   **`Cosmic Color Shift:`** The entire color palette of the universe will begin to slowly and continuously evolve through the spectrum.

### 3. Procedurally Generated Powers
You are not just a visitor; you are a force of nature. Your powers are randomized on each visit, assigned to your left and right mouse buttons. You must discover them through experimentation.

#### **Primary "Left-Click" Powers:**
*   **`Comet:`** A classic swirling attractor that gathers matter.
*   **`Void:`** A powerful repulsor that carves out empty space.
*   **`Chain Lightning:`** Hold to arc raw energy between nearby particles.
*   **`Time Warp:`** A field around your cursor that dramatically slows any particles that enter.
*   **`The Symbiote:`** Capture particles to form a living, writhing tail that follows your cursor.
*   **`Black Hole:`** A hyper-aggressive vortex that consumes and destroys any matter it touches.
*   **`Pulsar:`** Your cursor emits regular, powerful shockwaves.
*   **`The Alchemist:`** A strange force that doesn't move particles, but instantly changes their color.

#### **Secondary "Right-Click" Powers:**
*   **`Supernova:`** Instantly trigger a "Big Bang" explosion.
*   **`Wormhole:`** Create an entry and exit point to teleport particles across the canvas.
*   **`Gravity Well:`** Place a new, stationary gravity well on the canvas.
*   **`Cycle Shape:`** Right-click on particles to instantly change their form.
*   **`Anchor:`** Instantly freeze all particles in place, allowing you to create a static sculpture.
*   **`The Sculptor:`** Shrinks particles near the cursor.

## How to Use

This project is entirely self-contained.

1.  Save the code as a single `index.html` file.
2.  Open it in any modern web browser.
3.  Refresh the page to generate a new universe.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (for background gradients, animations, and glow effects)
*   **JavaScript (ES6)** (for the generative engine and all physics)
*   **particles.js:** Used as a lightweight rendering foundation, now heavily extended by a custom physics and interaction engine.
