# Celestial Canvas: A Generative Interactive Background

**Celestial Canvas** is not just a dynamic website background; it's a generative art piece. It leverages a powerful physics and aesthetics engine to create a completely unique, interactive cosmos every single time the page is loaded. There are no controls or UIâ€”the entire experience is about discovering the unique laws of each new universe and the surprising power you wield within it.

## Core Features

This project goes beyond simple randomization. It procedurally generates a unique set of rules and visuals for each session, resulting in a nearly infinite number of possible experiences.

### 1. Generative Universe Engine
On every page load, a new universe is born with its own unique properties:

*   **Procedural Physics:** The fundamental laws of motion are randomized. Particles might drift gently in a unified direction (`Cosmic Drift`), be trapped within the screen's bounds (`Contained Universe`), or wander freely into the void.
*   **Inter-Particle Gravity:** Some universes will have their own internal gravity, causing particles to naturally clump and form galaxies over time.
*   **Generative Aesthetics:**
    *   The background is a unique, multi-color animated gradient.
    *   Particles can be standard geometric shapes (circles, stars, polygons) or one of several custom image types (moons, starbursts, cosmic swirls).
    *   The fabric of space can be a void or an interconnected web (`Living Constellation`).
*   **Ambient Animation:** Some universes will feature particles that have a life of their own, gently "breathing" in size or "twinkling" in opacity.

### 2. Procedurally Generated User Power
Your interaction with the universe is also a surprise. The primary mouse-hold function is procedurally generated on each load, creating a unique "force profile" for you to discover. Your power might be:

*   A powerful **attractor** that pulls matter into a swirling vortex.
*   A strong **repulsor** that carves out empty space.
*   A gentle **gravity well** that forms stable orbital rings.
*   A **creator** force that paints new matter into the world.
*   ...or a subtle and unique **combination of all these properties**.

### 3. Advanced Physics-Based Interaction
The user's "force" is designed to feel physical and expressive:

*   **Orbital Mechanics:** Particles don't just move towards the cursor; they can be caught in its gravitational pull, creating beautiful, swirling orbits.
*   **Inertia and Friction:** All particles have a sense of weight. They are affected by a universal friction, causing forces to dissipate naturally and creating smoother, more organic motion.
*   **Dynamic Supernova:** For attractive forces, releasing the mouse creates a supernova explosion. The force and direction of this blast are directly influenced by the user's physical mouse movement, adding a layer of skill and expression.

### 4. Dual Interaction Model (Click vs. Hold)
The system intelligently distinguishes between two core user actions:

*   **Quick Click:** A fast press-and-release always creates a small burst of new particles at the cursor's location. It's a simple, satisfying, and creative spark.
*   **Press & Hold:** A longer press activates the session's unique, procedurally generated "Force Profile," unleashing a powerful and mysterious force that begs to be explored.

## How to Use

This project is entirely self-contained in a single file.

1.  Download the `index.html` file.
2.  Open it in any modern web browser.
3.  That's it! A new universe will be generated on every page load or refresh.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (for background gradients and animations)
*   **JavaScript (ES6)** (for all generative logic and physics)
*   **particles.js:** A lightweight library used for the core particle rendering and management, which has been heavily extended with our custom physics engine.
