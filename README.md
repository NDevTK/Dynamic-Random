# ‚ú® Celestial Canvas

**An interactive, generative cosmic sandbox for your browser.**

Celestial Canvas is a generative art experience where you can create and interact with unique, miniature universes. Each universe is procedurally generated from a shareable seed, complete with its own aesthetic, physical laws, interactive powers, and cosmic events.

Use your mouse as a cosmic force to attract, repel, warp, shatter, and paint the particles that inhabit your canvas. But be careful‚Äîpushing the universe too hard will build up energy, leading to a world-ending **Cataclysm** that births a new reality.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Procedural Universe Generation:** Every universe is generated from a unique, shareable seed string (e.g., `ASTRAL-WARP-4271`). No two universes are exactly alike.
*   **Deeply Interactive Physics:** Your mouse isn't just a pointer; it's an extension of your will. Left and right clicks unleash unique powers determined by the universe's blueprint.
*   **Ever-Expanding Universe Engine:** A complex system of interlocking, randomized components ensures immense variety:
    *   üåå **Blueprints:** Each universe is based on one of **26+** fundamental themes. Existing blueprints are now joined by new ones like `StellarNursery`, `AbyssalZone`, `TechnoUtopia`, `FungalForest`, `GlassySea`, `Papercraft`, and `ChromaticAberration`.
    *   üîÄ **Mutators:** Universes can be warped by one or more of **30+** mutators, like `Hyperspeed`, `Rainbow Particles`, `Clustering`, `Gravity Waves`, and new additions such as `PairBonding`, `Fragmenting`, `PhotonSails`, `ChaoticOrbits`, `TidalForces`, `Self-Propelled`, and `ReflectiveEdges`.
    *   üå† **Anomalies:** Discover persistent cosmic features that dramatically alter the simulation, such as `Pulsars`, `Black Holes`, `Cosmic Web`, `Quasar`, and the new `CosmicGeyser`, `CrystallineField`, `TemporalRift`, `NegativeSpace`, and `StellarWind`.
    *   üí• **Cataclysm System:** Constant interaction builds energy. When the universe becomes unstable, it triggers a spectacular, blueprint-specific cataclysm (e.g., `Supernova`, `Glitch Storm`, `False Vacuum Decay`, `The Bleed`, `SystemCrash`, `Shattering`) before regenerating into a new, random universe.
*   **Share Your Creations:** The current universe's seed is stored in the URL. Simply copy the URL to share your exact cosmic discovery with others.
*   **Modular Codebase:** The project is now organized into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for easier maintenance and contribution.

## üéÆ How to Use

### Running Locally
Because the project now uses JavaScript modules (`import`/`export`), you need to run it from a local web server to avoid CORS errors.

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Start a simple web server. If you have Python 3, you can run:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
4.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

The simulation will start immediately.

### Controls
*   **Move Mouse:** A passive glow follows your cursor, influencing particles in some universes.
*   **Left-Click (Hold):** Activates your primary power (e.g., attract particles, create tendrils, accelerate time).
*   **Right-Click (Hold or Click):** Activates your secondary power (e.g., unleash a supernova, create a stasis field, entangle particles).
*   **UI (Bottom Left):**
    *   Displays the current `Blueprint`, `Mutators`, and `Anomaly`.
    *   Click on the **Seed** text to copy the shareable URL to your clipboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **HTML5 / CSS3:** For the structure and vibrant visual styling.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules):** Powers the entire simulation logic, from the seeding engine to the physics and cataclysm events. The code is now split into logical modules (`main.js`, `effects.js`).
*   **particles.js:** Used as the base rendering engine for the particle system, which is then heavily modified and extended by the custom simulation loop.

## üîÆ Future Ideas

This project is a sandbox for creative coding. Potential future additions could include:

*   **Soundscapes:** Procedurally generated ambient audio that reacts to the universe's state and user interaction.
*   **More Blueprints, Mutators, and Anomalies:** The system is designed to be easily expandable with new and crazier ideas.
*   **Mobile/Touch Controls:** Adapting the experience for touch devices.
*   **A "Saved Seeds" Gallery:** A way to bookmark and revisit favorite universes.
